    The C11 and C++11 Concurrency Model
  Advisor: Peter Sewell
  Citation: |

    Mark Batty's dissertation makes significant contributions to the
    understanding of memory models for C and C++.  The ISO C++
    committee proposed a design for C and C++ concurrency that was not
    up to the task of capturing a realistic relaxed-memory concurrency
    model. Batty's work uncovered a number of subtle and serious flaws
    in the design, and produced an improved design in completely
    rigorous and machine-checked mathematics. Using software tools to
    explore the consequences of the design, derived directly from the
    mathematics, it showed that it has the desired behavior on many
    examples, and developed mechanized proofs that the design meets
    some of the original goals, showing that for programs in various
    subsets of the language one can reason in simpler models. The
    standards committee have adopted this work in their C11, C++11,
    and C++14 standards. The members of the award committee were
    impressed with the quality of the work, the impact it has had on
    the standardization process for C++, and the clarity of the
    presentation.

    Understanding and Expressing Scalable Concurrency    
  Advisor: Mitchell Wand
  Citation: |

    Aaron Turon's dissertation makes several major contributions to
    the design, implementation, and verification of scalable
    concurrent programs.  First, the dissertation presents "reagents",
    a high-level language of combinators for designing---and
    *composing*---lock-free data structures.  Second, the dissertation
    shows how lock-free data structures can be used to scalably
    implement Fournet and Gonthier's join calculus, in a newly
    re-engineered C# library that significantly outperforms prior
    lock-based implementations.  Third, the dissertation develops
    powerful theoretical foundations---based on logical relations and
    separation logic---for verifying the correctness of scalable
    concurrent algorithms via contextual refinement.  The members of
    the award committee were impressed with both the breadth and depth
    of the work, as well as the elegance of the exposition.

    Verifying Low-Level Programs via Liquid Type Inference
  Advisor: Ranjit Jhala
  Citation: |

    Patrick Rondonâ€™s dissertation makes several significant
    contributions to the field of automatic program verification.  It
    takes a type system -- a highly scalable yet not quite precise
    method of dealing with programs -- and refines it using
    Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) techniques to compensate for
    the precision loss.  There are implementations for both OCaml and
    C.  The achieved degree of effectiveness and automation is
    astonishing: programs that are beyond the existing verification
    tools can be handled fully automatically within seconds.  It
    demonstrates that formal verification can yield significant
    reliability guarantees for mainstream software engineering, at a
    reasonable cost.  In addition, the thesis contains a comprehensive
    formalization with very detailed, readable proofs.  The members of
    the award committee were impressed by the quality of the work and
    the clarity of the presentation.

    Simplified Semantics and Debugging of Concurrent Programs via Targeted Race Detection
  Advisor: Todd Millstein
  Citation: |

    This dissertation addresses the problem of obtaining reliable
    results from concurrent programs. As a first step, the
    dissertation presents LiteRace, which uses sampling to dynamically
    detect race conditions. As a second step, the dissertation
    presents DRFx, which is a memory model that enforces sequential
    consistency, where hardware and software share responsibility for
    detecting violations of sequential consistency. Finally, the
    dissertation presents the design of an optimizing compiler that
    preserves sequential consistency. The dissertation thus
    demonstrates how a revised distribution of responsibilities among
    programmers, programming languages, and hardware can help detect
    and avoid concurrency violations. The committee was impressed with
    the dissertation's broad vision for both the problems of
    concurrency and the possible solutions.

    An Effect System and Language for Deterministic-by-Default Parallel Programming
  Advisor: Vikram Adve
  Citation: |

    This dissertation makes several significant contributions to the
    field of parallel and concurrent programming. The main technical
    contribution is a type and effect system that enables reasoning
    about non-interference at a fine granularity. A second
    contribution is support for non-deterministic code sections that
    are explicitly marked as such. A third contribution is support for
    object-oriented frameworks, where user extensions are guaranteed
    to adhere to the framework's effect restrictions. These
    contributions are backed by formal models, soundness proofs, and
    the Deterministic Parallel Java implementation. Evaluation shows
    that highly satisfactory speedups can be achieved on interesting
    code bases, sometimes beating the performance of hand-crafted
    implementations. The members of the award committee were impressed
    by the quality of the work and the clarity of the presentation.

    Other: Interprocedural Analysis and the Verification of Concurrent Programs
    Advisor: Thomas Reps
    Citation: |

      This dissertation develops improvements to interprocedural
      program analysis through context-bounded analysis and through
      Lal's extended weighted push down systems, which generalize
      weighted push down systems to handle local variables. The
      dissertation describes both algorithms and experiments, and it
      shows, for example, a 30-fold speedup over existing algorithms
      for analyzing concurrent programs. The members of the award
      committee were impressed by the unusual scope and depth of the
      dissertation and its excellent presentation.

  - Awardee: "William Thies, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

    Advisor: Saman Amarasinghe
    Citation: |
      This dissertation describes the StreamIt synchronous dataflow
      language, for which Thies led the definition. The language
      supports several novel constructs, notably teleport
      messaging. Thies's dissertation includes a technique for
      processing compressed video data, and it also describes dynamic
      analysis techniques to convert legacy C applications to
      streaming applications. The members of the award committee were
      impressed with the novelty, interdisciplinary nature, and
      breadth of the work, the care given to evaluation, and the
      quality of the presentation.

    Other: Diagnosing and Tolerating Bugs in Deployed Systems
    Advisor: Kathryn McKinley
    Citation: |

      This dissertation makes several significant contributions to the
      problems of tracking down and tolerating software errors in
      deployed systems. It proposes a variety of techniques, ranging
      from a breakthrough, probabilistic method of compactly
      representing calling contexts, to novel techniques for tracking
      null pointers, to garbage collector modifications that let
      programs tolerate memory leaks. The evaluation committee was
      impressed by Michael's fresh perspective on these problems and
      the thorough experimental evaluation by which he backs up his
      claims. His research has already had broad adoption and impact,
      and we believe that his techniques will be brought to bear on a
      wide range of future applications.

    Other: Modular Fine-grained Concurrency Verification
    Advisor: Alan Mycroft and Matthew Parkinson
    Citation: |

      This dissertation introduces a novel logic for reasoning about
      concurrent shared-memory programs. This logic subsumes both
      rely/guarantee reasoning and separation logic in an elegant and
      natural manner. The dissertation establishes the semantic
      properties of the logic and demonstrates its applicability on a
      range of highly complex concurrent algorithms and data
      structures.  The evaluation committee found the clarity of
      Viktor's presentation and the technical depth of his results
      particularly compelling, and we believe that this work creates a
      foundation for new tools and automated techniques for reasoning
      about concurrent programs.

    Logics and Algorithms for Software Model Checking
  Advisor: Rajeev Alur
  Citation: |

    The thesis explores a formalism called nested trees, that can
    represent complex branching behavior (loops and recursion) and
    support modular statement of context-sensitive correctness
    conditions. It further makes a specific technical contribution by
    offering the first algorithm for reachability in in nested trees
    that is sub-cubic in performance. The committee believes this work
    has great potential for long-term utility.

    Fault Location via Dynamic Slicing
  Advisor: Rajiv Gupta
  Citation: |

    Dynamic slicing is a technique for determining which variables and
    data structures affected values causing a fault (bug) at a
    particular location in a particular run of a program, thus
    allowing a programmer to work backwards to determine the ultimate
    cause of a fault. Previously this approach was too expensive to
    use in practice. Zhang has improved the performance by orders of
    magnitude, making it practical. The committee believes this work
    will have considerable impact and value in practice.
